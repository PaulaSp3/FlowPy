# Flow-Py

Flow-Py is an adaptable open source implementation of existing approaches to GMM (gravitational mass movements) run out models. The main objective of this tool is to compute the spatial run out distribution (routing and stopping) for GMMs in three dimensional terrain. This model has been designed to be computationally light, allowing it application on a regional scale. 

The data based (empirical) modeling approach Flow-Py combining routing and stopping run out in three dimensional terrain allowing to identify process areas and corresponding magnitudes. The model is motivated by a combination of existing process and data based approaches, requiring a minimum of input data, providing valuable output. By considering the spatial evolution (no temporal evolution equations are solved in the model) the resulting run out is mainly dependent by the terrain and the location of the starting point

The model is written in Python to keep it easy adjustable. The run out routine of Flow-Py is based on the principles of energy 
conservation including frictional dissipation assuming simple coulomb friction, leading to constant travel-angle. 
Potential release areas and the corresponding travel angle have to be adapted for each type of gravitational mass movements. 
A important improvement, compared to similar models, is that it can handle mass movement in flat and uphill terrain. 
One major advantage of this model is its simplicity, resulting in a computationally inexpensive implementation, which 
allows for an application on a regional scale, covering large simulation areas. The adaptivity of the model further 
allows to consider existing infrastructure and to detect starting zones endangering the corresponding areas in a back-calculation step. 

## Running the Code

python3 main.py --gui -> Gui Version  
python3 main.py alpha_angle exponent working_directory path_to_dem path_to_release infra=path_to_infrastructure(Optional) flux_threshold=positiv_number(Optional) max_z_delta=positiv_number(Optional)

- alpha_angle: max. runout angle for the process: Austria -> Avalanche 25, Rockfall 35, Debris Slides 22 
- exponent: controls the lateral spreading, avalanches 8, rockfall and debris slides 75 (= single flow, except in flat terrain) 
- working_directory: where to create and save result folder 
- path_to_dem: well it's the path to the DEM (.asc or .tif)
- path_to_release: well it's the path to the release layer 
- path_to_infrastructure: well it's the path to the Infra layer, Optional!
- flux_threshold: when Flow-Py stops the spreading, Standard = 0.0003, Optional!
- max_z_delta: The max. z_delta your process can reach. Some hints: Avalanche = 270 /  Rockfall = 50 / Soil Slides = 12 / Standard = 8848 (no limitation), Optional!

Right now the Code works on Linux and Windows Machines. Haven't tested it on MacOS, if you are able to run it there, please give us feedback.
Run the Code via the main.py script: python3 main.py ...  
Some PyQt libraries are needed and rasterio.  
There is the requirements.txt file in the repo that includes all needed libraries. (Work in progress...)

## Input Files

All input files need to be .asc or .tif files.  
All files need the same raster resolution, normal sizes are 5x5 or 10x10 meters.  
All Layers need the exact same extend. If not, the Code will give you feedback which layer is not accurate.

### Input Files:

- DEM:
	- The DEM Raster file needs a no data value lower then zero. standard = -9999
	
- Release Zones:
	- The release layer needs values higher then zero for the release pixels. NoData < 0, or -9999
### Optional Input Files:

- Infrastructure:
	- The infrastructure layer needs values higher then zero for infrastructure. Different values can be used for 
	different infrastructures classes and will be saved in the backcalculation.
	- The backcalculation layer has the information of the infrastructure that was hit. Higher values win over lower ones.
## Output

- z_delta:
    Includes the highest z_delta for every pixel.
- Sum of z_delta:
    z_delta summed up on every pixel.
- Flux:
    The result of the flux calculation for every pixel.
- Cell Counts:
    Saves how often one pixel gets a hit from different release points.
- Backcalculation:
    Saves the backcalculation from Infrastructure to release point
- Flow Path Travel Angle, FP_TA:
    Saves the &gamma; angle along the flow path
- Straight Line Travel Angle, SL_TA:
    Saves the &gamma; angle, while the distances are calculated via a straight line from the release cell to the current cell
## Calculation Steps

### z_delta 

![Image](img/Motivation_2d.png)
*Fig. 1: Definition of angles and distances for the calculation of z_delta, where s is the distance along the path and z(s) the corresponding altitude.*

The model equations that control the avalanche run out in three dimensional terrain are mostly motivated with respect to simple two dimensional concepts, that control the main routing and final stopping of the flow.

Figure 1 summarizes the basic concept of a constant run out angle with the corresponding geometric relations in two dimensions along a possible process path.

The Motivation for the equations that are solved to calculate the runout distance, comes from a simple 2D model with a defined maximum runout angle alpha.

![tan_alpha](img/tan_alpha.png)

The angle gamma is defined by the height and distance difference from the release point to the current calculation step.

![tan_gamma](img/tan_gamma.png)

The angle delta is the difference between gamma and alpha, so when delta equals zero or gamma equals alpha, the maximum runout distance is reached and the calculation stops.

![z_alpha](img/z_alpha.png)

... energy in the process... z_alpha can be interpreted as dissipation energy

![z_gamma](img/z_gamma.png)

Z_gamma can be interpreted as the energy left in the system and Z_delta is again the difference between Z_gamma and Z_alpha, so when Z_delta is lower or equal zero the calculation stops.

![z_delta](img/z_delta.png)

To bring this thoughts now from the 2D model to a 3D grid we must implement a few new definitions.

â€‹	![grid_overview](img/Neighbours.png)

First we need to bring in the definition for base. This is the current raster cell we are looking at, and from which we do our calculations. This would be at distance s along the path in Fig. 1. 

Every base can have one or more parents, except the starting cell, where we start our calculation, this would be s = s_0 in Fig. 1.

From the base we solve now the equations ... for every neighbor n, if Z_bn^{delta} is higher then zero, this neighbor is defined as a child of this base, and spreading is allowed in this direction.

![z_delta_i](img/z_delta_array.png)

As Z_bn^{delta} can be interpreted as (kinectic energy? or velocity) we implemented a maximum value for this. Regarding physical models this would correspond to a turbulent friction. 

![z_delta_max](img/z_delta_max.png)

Equations for S_n...

With this equations we determine the maximum distance for the process, in the next steps we will explain how we handle and calculate the spreading on the 3D grid.

### Terrain based routing

The terrain based routing is dependent on the slope angle. The Holmgren (1994) algorithm [1] is used in different kind of models and works well for avalanches but also rockfall or soil slides.
The exponent exp allows to control the divergence of the spreading. For avalanches a exponent of 8 shows good results.
To reach a single flow in step terrain, an exponent of 75 is considered.

![Holmgrem](img/flow_direction.png)
*Holmgrem Algorithm from 1994 [1]*

In this equation i, j are the flow directions, T_i the flux proportion in direction i, 
tan(beta_i) the slope gradient between the base cell and the cell in direction i, and exp the variable exponent. 
When the exponent increases, the divergence is reduced up to resulting into a single flow direction when 
exp &rightarrow; &infin;. This parameter allows to control the spreading and to reproduce a wide range of other flow 
accumulations.
This approach works for tan(beta) > 0. To take in account flow in flat terrain and upwards, in this case 
tan(beta) < 0, this approach was changed to the range for tangents from -90 degrees to 90 degrees, as seen in 
Fig. 2.

### Persistence Function

The persistence function P_i aims to reproduce the behavior of inertia, and weights the flow 
direction based on the change in direction with respect to the previous direction (see Fig. 3) [3].
We introduced to scale the direction with z_delta of the incoming direction (z_delta,parent), 
so the direction from a cell with higher z_delta will have more affect to the directions where the base cell spreads.

![](img/persistence.png)

The weights are defined by the cosine of the direction angles:

*Fig. 3: jkh*

### Flux 

The values given by the flow direction algorithm and the weighting of the persistence are combined according to Eq.(13)

![](img/susceptibility.png)

where i, j are the flow directions, p_i is the susceptibility value in direction i, p_i^(fd) 
the flow proportion according to the flow direction algorithm, p_i^p the flow proportion according 
to the persistence, and p_0 the previously determined susceptibility value of the central cell. 
For a release cell p_0 equals one. \
The result of Eq.(13) is a 3 x 3 array with assigned susceptibility values. A normalization stage is then 
required to bring the sum of the cells to the value of p_0. 
This aims at avoiding loss of susceptibility [2].
